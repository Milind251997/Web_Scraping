"Gangnam Style saved my life. I was a lonely widow who had just lost my job, my heart broken by my boyfriend and lost my son to a violent murder. After that i have gained extreme depression. I had no money to pay my taxes and my house was near to getting demolished. I cried myself to sleep everynight. My family is dead and my sister faked her own death. Until, I was once scrolling through youtube as a music video to a song by the title ""Gangnam Style"" caught my eye immediately. As soon as the first melody played, I fell in love. My depression vanished and all my worries went away. I was able to finally see the true meaning to life with the help of this song. Thank you Psy for making such a wonderful song. I am now married with 3 kids, a beautiful husband and an amazing life. I am also a preschool teacher now and is now living the best life all thanks to ""Gangnam Style"".",4,1 week ago
